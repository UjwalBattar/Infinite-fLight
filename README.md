# Infinite fLight

fLights is an endless flying game. Users would navigate though a "course" avoiding obstacles using the left and right arrows. Time-boosts would add 10 seconds to the clock. Points would be accumulated based on time lapsed.No levels and no real win scenario, just try to get as far as you can. One life, one shot at the title. Did I mention the theme would be neon lights?
